## Project Description

A project for the Yandex Practicum Web development course where I created an interactive SPA for searching and saving movies.<br>

It is a full-stack project, so I had an opportunity to practice both frontend and backend parts. One of the main challenges for me was figuring out how to implement a working search filter using API data and authorisation with cookies. Apart from that, it was interesting and fun to learn how to dynamically save and delete movies from favourites.<br>

This project allowed me to practice node.js, REST API, and MongoDB.<br>

### Features

- Users registration and authorisation
- Movies search input with “short movies” filter
- Saving and deleting movies cards
- Opportunity to edit the profile info

### Status

Finished.


## Techs  

- Node.js + Express.js 4.18.1
- MongoDB
- REST API<br>
